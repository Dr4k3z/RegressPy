# RegressionAlgorithms
Regression and classification algorithms written from scratch in Python. The only python libraries required to run these scripts are:
- Numpy, used to manage arrays, Matrix multiplication and a bit of linear algebra (Inverting matrices for instance)
- Pandas, to read csv files
- Matplotlib.pyplot, to plot the results 

The repository contains files to perform both regression task and classification task. The former is currently implemented using polynomial regression and locally weighted linear regression, while the latter employs standard logistic regression, locally weighted logistic regression and kth nearest neighbor. 

I do have plans to extended this repository with many other algorithms and eventually to make a library out of it. If you have any suggestions or you'd like to be a part of this project feel free to contact me on my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-campagnoli-3a515b1bb/ or my Twitter: @MatteoCampagno6

P.S. A little side note, these algorithms are also being implemented in C++, using a self-written Linear Algebra library called Spectral. In the future I'd like to publish both of them.
